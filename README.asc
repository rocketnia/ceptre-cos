A Ceptre Implementation of the Calculus of Structures
-----------------------------------------------------

This is still a work in progress with a few omissions and a general lack of polish. For instance, one thing left unpolished for now is this readme.

The file cos.cep is a working link:https://github.com/chrisamaphone/interactive-lp[Ceptre ruleset]. If you run it, it will challenge you to apply the right inference rules to prove a certain example theorem. If you reduce the whole structure to linear logic's bottom, aka \_|_, aka the unit of par, aka the unit of multiplicative disjunction, then you've successfully completed the proof!
